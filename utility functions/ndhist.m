function binned_data=ndhist(data,M)
% this function computes the histogram
% of an n-dimensional data set;
% 'data' is nrows by n columns
% M is the number of bins used in each dimension
% so that 'binned_data' is a hypercube with
% size length equal to M;
% data is assumed to range from 0 to 1 & all values outside this range are
% discarded
% modified form of internal function from kde2d.m
%  Reference:
% Kernel density estimation via diffusion
