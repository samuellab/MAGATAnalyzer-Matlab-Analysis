This directory contains useful classes that are generally specific to a particular experiment

For instance, I plan to create a checkerboard experiment class, a directional stimulus experiment class, and a temporal temperature experiment class

Classes here generally shouldn't be subclassed (if you think this is a more general application, make a new class in the main folder)
